&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This AI can do anything. It works by taking input and looking to see if it's encountered that input before. If it has, it looks at the available outputs and picks a random one. You then click "OK" if it's a valid output. If it's not a valid output, it removes it. If you choose to then reward it, it duplicates that output. If you punish it, it deletes that output. If you skip, it moves on. If it doesn't recognize the input, it takes note of it and, depending on how many outputs you set to allow it, it gives it all possible outputs and then re runs, this time knowing the input. You can also export the brain by copying it and import it at the beginning by pasting it.
